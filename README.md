# Uno Card Game Simulation
An object oriented modelling of the beloved UNO card game using C# programming language. Inspired by [this tutorial](https://exceptionnotfound.net/modeling-practice-uno-in-c-sharp-part-one-rules-assumptions-cards/).
The tutorial outlines an application that runs seven automatic rounds of UNO with computer-generated players. I added functionality to include a human player, such that the game accepts user input for the human player's moves, validates these inputs to ensure they are legal according to UNO rules, and allows the human player to compete against the computer-generated player.
